# completely cleared out for 2022, bring things in piecemeal
#
# remember, these are used for both the workbooks as well as the main page
# so we do have references to the main page.
# it got crazy unweildy very quickly
#
# this year, we'll divide things up...
# we'll have a different shortcode - for different things
#   page (this DB) things on the external web that we expect to be permanent
#   cweb - things on the course web that workbooks refer to
#   cfile - canvas files (auto generated db)
